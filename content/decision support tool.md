- done by an MDT - at least 2 professionals from different healthcare professions, OR one professional from one healthcare profession and one person whose job is to assess care needs
- but should usually have health AND social care professionals with knowledge of the patient's needs, and it possible have been part of the assessment, treatment or care of the patient. 
- main purpose is to make a recommendation on eligibility 
- individual or representative - should be actively involved. Best practice is for the assessors to meet the patient before the MDT meeting.
 
### identifying an individual's needs

- based on evidence of needs from a range of assessments of the patient - looking at needs 'in the round' 
- the patient/their representative should be able to play a central role in the process
- patients own views should be given appropriate weight - assessments should be done in a conversational fashion

### use of the DST
- not in itself a needs assessment - away of tying evidence together in one format. A a multidisciplinary assessment of needs is required to complete it.
- The tool "Supports the process" Of determining eligibility, but does not directly determine such. Professional judgment should be used to ensure the level of need is correctly determined.
- Recommendation should be clear + concise, with sufficient detail to communicate the rationale. Should include:
	- summary of needs, including patient's views
	- statements about nature, intensity, complexity and unpredictability of needs
	- explanation of how needs might combine & interact
	- give a recommendation as to whether or not a primary health need exists
	- if no needs are identified, a rationale must be provided.
- 12 care domains:
	1. Breathing
	2. Nutrition
	3. Continence
	4. Skin integrity
	5. Mobility
	6. Communication
	7. Psychological/emotional needs
	8. Cognition
	9. Behaviour
	10. Drug therapies + medication
	11. Altered states of consciousness
	12. Over significant care needs

		Figure 1: Diagram which shows how the different care domains are divided into levels of need
	#### key:
	
Each domain is subdivided into statements of need representing no needs (N), low (L), 
moderate (M), high (H), severe (S) or priority (P) levels of need, depending on the domain.  These increase in intensity and unpredictability.

For Breathing, the levels are: (N), low (L), moderate (M), high (H), severe (S) or priority (P)

For Nutrition â€“ Food and Drink, the levels are: (N), low (L), moderate (M), high (H), severe (S) 

For Continence, the levels are: (N), low (L), moderate (M), high (H)

For Skin and tissue viability, the levels are: (N), low (L), moderate (M), high (H), severe (S) 

For Mobility, the levels are: (N), low (L), moderate (M), high (H), severe (S)

For Communication, the levels are: (N), low (L), moderate (M), high (H)

For Psychological and emotional needs, the levels are: (N), low (L), moderate (M), high (H)

For Cognition, the levels are: (N), low (L), moderate (M), high (H), severe (S) 

For Behaviour, the levels are: (N), low (L), moderate (M), high (H), severe (S) or priority (P)

For Drug therapies etc, the levels are: (N), low (L), moderate (M), high (H), severe (S) or priority (P)

For Altered States of Consciousness, the levels are: (N), low (L), moderate (M), high (H), or priority (P)

For Other Significant care needs, the levels are: (N), low (L), moderate (M), high (H), severe (S)
