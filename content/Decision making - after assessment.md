ICB - integrated care board

- Decisions to not accept an MDT recommendation should not be based on budget concerns
- should get written confirmation including
	- decision on primary health need and eligibility for NHSCC
	- reasons for the decision
	- A copy of the DST
	- details to contact for further info.
	- how to request a review
	- if not eligible, info about available options /joint care packages
	- if eligible, an indication of the proposed care package, or info about next steps
## timeframe

ICB normally takes 2 days to respond to MDT recommendations. 

### review

- review with 3 months of initial decision
	- look at care plan - still appropriate?
	- if evidence of change in needs that may impact eligibility then a full reassessment takes place
	- if no, make any required adjustments to care plan
	- further reviews at least annually or according to clinical judgment
