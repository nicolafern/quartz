If someone has a primary health need, they will be eligible for NHSCC, and the NHS will be responsible for ALL assessed health AND social care needs, including accommodation if it is part of the overall need.

Assessment is done by an MDT to decide it a person has a primary health need - assessment is done with the national Decision Support Tool (DST). 

This hinges upon whether the main areas, or the majority of the care needed, is to ADDRESS or PREVENT heath needs.

> To me, that means active treatment or prevention of worsening?

It's not about the reason for care or support, or a diagnosis - it's the level/type of care needs as a whole.

## Ineligibility

Only where nursing or other health services required are:
- no more than incidental or subsidiary to the provision of accommodation that the council or Nan should fund
- not beyond those the council would be expected to provide

### Characteristics of need
- nature - type, impact of need and the characteristics of the interventions required to manage them
- intensity - quantity + degree of need and support required to meet
- complexity - presentation, skills required to monitor, treat, manage care. Can include impacts resulting from overall needs, **including MH - ie- nan's suicidal thoughts and plans.**
- unpredictability - how much needs fluctuate, which makes then harder to manage

Can be a combination or a single characteristic that demonstrates a primary health need. How well-managed a need is does not have a bearing on decision making.

Financial issues should NOT be considered.



### decision should not be based on:
- diagnoses
- care settings
- ability of care provider to manage care
- use or not of NHS staff to provide care
- need or not for 'specialist staff in care provision
- now well-managed a need is
- other NHS funded care provision
- anything else not related to needs

Eligibily is not indefinite, and could change according to needs.
